## Lab 5: Pedometer App ## 
  The Pedometer application counts the users’ steps when they walk or run. It lets users know the number of calories they burn, distance walked, walking time and speed per hour. Users just need to launch the application, put the smartphone in their pocket or continue to use it as usual and the Pedometer application will record their steps in the background. The application uses a SQLite database to save the record.
